This is a tool that makes delta hedges easier. It automatically calculates the delta of the option position
and tells you how many underlying shares you should buy or sell. It also takes a threshold for the delta
so you can adjust as often as you need. Finally, it sends email notifications whenever a trade is required.

To run:
  -install required python libraries using "pip install package-name-here"
  -run "npm init -y" to install nodejs
  -run server using "node app.js" command
  -run python notebook
